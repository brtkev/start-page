# start page

custom staring page for my browsing 
you can see it [here](https://brtkev.github.io/start-page/)

## todo:
- fix ico bundling
- responsiveness
- change search engine
- add database
- change the links and names without having to hardcode them

## learned/new to me:
webpack in general, a little bit of babel, and a lot of postcss, which was most configuring.
I did my [react template](https://github.com/brtkev/react-light-template) in the process so that's why I learned those things
I learned to change to a new page using window.locate

## ideas

to have a main category on the header ✅

search on the middle ✅

footer be a list of links to important pages ✅
