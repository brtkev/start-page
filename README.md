# start page

custom staring page for my browsing 
you can see it [here](https://brtkev.github.io/start-page/)

## todo:
- fix ico bundling ✅
- responsiveness ✅
- change search engine option
- add db
- change the links and names without having to hardcode them

## learned/new to me:
webpack in general, a little bit of babel, and a lot of postcss, which was most configuring.
I did my [react template](https://github.com/brtkev/react-light-template) in the process so that's why I learned those things
I learned to change to a new page using window.locate and to change the favico with javascript

ok, so I decided to add back-end to it but, I know close to nothing about back-end so,  learning the ways of express and moongose/mongodb

## ideas/thoughts

to have a main category on the header ✅

search on the middle ✅

footer be a list of links to important pages ✅

>so I wasn't feeling good about the result of the mobile design but after looking at it from my phone I think it's cool
